Hey Teresa,

Haha no I will not solve the mystery of life for my project... probably.  That is the ultimate goal though.  I mean really, what more worthy endeavor?  I love mysteries that have confounded generations of smart humans trying really really hard.  

Harmonic resonance is a wave interaction phenomena.  If two waves collide (or superimpose, or whatever it is waves do), their interaction is mediated by the ratio of their wavelengths.  If they are unrelated they will interfere with eachother and cancel eachother out.  If they are similar or some pure ratio however, their mutual waves will reinforce eachother and perpetuate the original signal.  If the signals reinforce eachother we call that "resonance".  Harmonic just refers to the series of ratios that induce resonances in one another, a mathematical relationship really.  

So the idea is that when the expectation signals from above are in synchrony with the perception signals from below they will find a mutual resonance, while unmatching signals will cancel, thereby finding the most adequate explanation among many competing explanations based on resonating dynamics.  

This is my guess anyway, we'll see if it works.  It is an experiment!

As for EXPERIENCE, not sure that can be formalized, or else we need new forms of formalization, which someday could be entirely possible.  But as for now I'm not sure an equation or computer simulation will cut it!  : D   No one knows what experience is of course, but everyone has their hypothesis.  I think it is fundamentally an electrical phenomenon, or something to do with the merging of whatever we call electrical fields into a coherent macroscopic entity.  No one really understands what charge or an electric field is either, so that doesn't really explain anything.  But the evidence is there for the fact that the necessary thing for consciousness is that neural assemblies fire in synchrony, while the rest of the brain hangs back in a background of uncorrelated firing.  Neurons are firing all the time, but only synchronous assemblies correspond to conscious thoughts?  Seems telling.  Those pulsations I am guessing are uniting, merging into a continuous field.  Who knows?  Still no explanation on how that makes experience, ha.  We are many years away from understanding anything really.  But so fun to try!

In the meantime, there is a lot of uncharted territory for understanding how living things work, and a lot of useful work to be done in just grappling with the concepts living systems have to offer us before we come close to unravelling any mysteries of life just yet.

| Ryan,
| I really enjoyed reading your inspiration piece. You have a very enjoyable writing style and you are obviously passionate about this field. That is wonderful! Do you think you will solve the mystery of the meaning of life for your project? (That would be totally awesome, but I promise I won't hold you to it.)
| 
| Say, I do not know what harmonic resonance is. And I do not know much about cellular automata or dynamics. So I am afraid I do not have many suggestions for you in your quest for knowledge for the literature review. But I can wholeheartedly agree that the circular causality is almost overwhelmingly amazing and the mystery of experience would be an incredible direction for study.
| 
| So remember that I have no background whatsoever in this field, but I wonder if experience can be formalized. I wonder if formally defining “raw experience” would somehow deflate the meaning of the word itself. Can we respond to things without experiencing them? Like on autopilot? Can we experience things at different levels? It seems possible that the deepest, most meaningful level of experience might be really difficult to quantify, measure, or simulate. Those are just my thoughts. But I would be so excited if you could “prove me wrong” so to speak. 
| 
| I wonder if areas like artificial life or artificial intelligence would be interesting for you. I also wanted to suggest to you that you might want to jump in and start studying how these things are currently being modeled. If neural networks and cellular dynamics are already being modeled (seems like they would be), then you might be able to make more headway with your project if you start by reviewing that literature, rather than more philosophical or biological literature on life processes. Just an idea – do what seems to feel right as you explore the literature.
| 
| Also, I wanted to suggest that if you find a really cool simulation that is already developed and published, you could always recreate that simulation and extend it somehow – maybe using NetLogo or one of the other programs we play with in the class. You don’t have to recreate the wheel and start from scratch. If you can find someone else’s wheel and extend it to include operational closure (I don’t know what that means either), that would also be awesome.

| Feel free to email me back with questions or to continue this discussion.
| Forward ho!
