Unlike, say, Chopin's piano pieces, J. S. Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier is not
a cycle written to exploit the capabilities of 'a' particular instrument.
Instead these pieces are a mind-bogging record of sheer human ingenuity:
Striking as they may be, individually, taken as a whole they embody an
unparalleled record of never-ending novelties... If not an even more striking
novelty than the one before it, at the very least every piece makes you
scratch your head as to how Bach could have yet come up with one more such
wondrous a curiosity--Not merely as in the complete conception of each piece
but also in the case of almost every musical phrase after musical phrase
throughout all the works in the assembly. And still there are pieces here
which are beatiful beyond telling.

I am making these files available now (rather than later) because I have
reached a point of diminishing returns in their editing. That is,
theoretically the pieces can always come closer still to the way I think they
ought to be interpreted --but not by so much that it justifies my spending
all that much more effort on it. Although it was fun while it lasted, it's
time to work on something else now.

As a point of departure you must understand that I use the SoundBlaster AWE32
card (on a P.120 PC): This card comes with digitally sampled instruments. [I
use Master Tracks Pro.]

On other software (provided the hardware is capable of digitally-sampled
instruments), if you don't know how to avoid the FM banks of
computer-generated instruments try the Midi Mapper (which might have been
properly programmed with your card's wave table instruments).

These files are set to a minimum 'stereo' pan. The following set of
'controls' instructions are for the AWE32 card, but users of other cards may
deduce the effect I'm after from them...

for the CREATIVE MIXER: set the Treble, Bass, and MIDI Volumes to their
loudest possible settings. Then set MAIN VOLUME to play at your own paticular
comfort level. NOTE that the note 'velocities' in these files are set to the
loudest possible setting (whenever and wherever possible).  Set all
right/left 'balances' as close as possible to the center.

for the AWE32 CONTROL PANEL: Use the Qsound (not Reverb and Chorus).

for the BOB (break-out box): Make sure all the controller 'boxes' (under the
M's) are unchecked... Save this setting to the default.bob file if need be:
When any box is 'checked' it interferes with the controller information sent
by the midi files for proper playback.
